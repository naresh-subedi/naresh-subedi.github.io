  abstract = { The behavior of base-isolated buildings under near-fault (NF) ground motions with fling-step and forward-directivity characteristics is investigated using three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models. Nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA) is also carried out after removing the dominant pulse from the NF ground motion records. The results obtained for 10-story base-isolated buildings with and without shear walls, indicate that NF ground motions with fling-step and forward-directivity characteristics produce large inter-story drift ratios and floor accelerations, compared to the case when the dominant pulse is removed. Additional NLRHA carried out using artificial pulses shows that the isolator and superstructure responses are larger for pulses with fling-step characteristics, compared to pulses with forward-directivity characteristics. }

  abstract = {Concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) piles with thin-walled tubes are widely used as foundations for buildings and bridges in high seismic regions. To design these piles for large earthquakes, it is necessary to test specimens of realistic size under axial loads representative of actual design conditions. However, previous experimental studies of CFSTs were carried out mostly on small-diameter specimens with small or no axial load. To address this issue, cyclic flexural tests were conducted on five large-scale CFST pile specimens under varying axial load, with the range of axial load ratio (−0.21 to 0.38) and internal reinforcement as test variables. The specimens had a diameter of 1200 mm and diameter-to-thickness ratio of 125. This study discusses issues relevant to the design and performance assessment of piles such as moment capacity, hysteretic response, damage progression, strain distribution, and strain limits. It is observed that the ultimate condition of CFST piles is governed by the rupture of the tube, and these piles retain axial load-carrying capacity even after the tube ruptures. Internal reinforcement is effective to improve the deformation capacity and energy dissipation of piles. These findings contribute towards the rational seismic design of CFST pile foundations for large earthquakes.}

  abstract = {This study provides guidelines for the detailed finite-element modeling and efficient fiber-based analysis of noncompact/slender CFSTs under axial compression. To this end, a finite-element model capable of explicitly simulating the interaction between the concrete and steel tube is developed in LS-DYNA. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified using a database of ninety-six noncompact and slender CFSTs compiled from the literature. In addition, seven sets of most commonly used stress-strain models for the fiber-based analysis of CFSTs are briefly reviewed. The suitability of the stress-strain models to simulate the behavior under axial compression is evaluated using the experimental data in the compiled database and the finite element analysis results. The results show that the proposed finite-element model reasonably simulates the axial compression response of noncompact and slender CFSTs. For the fiber-based approach, Sakino's model gives the best prediction of the full-range axial load-displacement response. Findings from this study will help the designers and researchers to select appropriate modeling approaches and model parameters for the design and analysis of noncompact and slender CFSTs.}
