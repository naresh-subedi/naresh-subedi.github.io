Hello, welcome to my website. My name is Naresh Subedi. I am a structural engineer at Kozo Keikau Engineering Inc., Tokyo.

I completed my PhD in Civil Engineering from the Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Tech), where I was advised by Susumu (Sam) Kono and Anil C. Wijeyewickrema.  

On this website, I have listed some information about myself, my publications, and research interests. Please feel free to have a look around or contact me.
