Hello, welcome to my website. 

My name is Naresh Subedi. I am a structural engineer at <a href="https://www.kke.co.jp/en/">Kozo Keikau Engineering Inc.</a>, Tokyo.

I obtained my PhD in Civil Engineering from the <a href="https://www.isct.ac.jp/en">Institute of Science Tokyo</a> (formerly Tokyo Tech), where I was advised by <a href="https://www.kono.first.iir.titech.ac.jp/">Susumu (Sam) Kono</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UzGGGNQAAAAJ&hl=en"> Anil C.

On this website, I have listed some information about myself, my publications, and research interests. 

Please feel free to have a look around or contact me.
